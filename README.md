# What are Discord Webhooks?

Webhooks are a low-effort way to post messages to channels in Discord. They do not require a bot user or authentication to use.

# Discord Bots

Check out [botder](https://github.com/botder)'s [mtasa-discord-bot Project](https://github.com/botder/mtasa-discord-bot) that lets you connect a Discord Bot application to your MTA:SA server, which are more powerful than webhooks.
